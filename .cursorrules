# Cursor Rules for Shopify Hydrogen Project

## Project Context
This is a Shopify Hydrogen storefront built with React Router 7, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Code Style & Conventions
- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Follow React Router 7 patterns (not Remix)
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Use GraphQL fragments from `app/lib/fragments.ts`
- Follow existing component patterns in `app/components/`

## Shopify-Specific
- Always use Storefront API (not Admin API) for storefront operations
- Use GraphQL queries from `app/graphql/` when available
- Generate types with `npm run codegen` after schema changes
- Environment variables are in `.env` (never commit this file)

## File Structure
- Components: `app/components/`
- Routes: `app/routes/` (file-based routing)
- GraphQL: `app/graphql/`
- Utilities: `app/lib/`
- Styles: `app/styles/`

## MCP Integration
- Shopify MCP is configured for GraphQL schema validation and documentation
- Figma MCP is configured for design-to-code workflows
- Use MCP tools when generating Shopify components or validating GraphQL queries

## Best Practices
- Always validate GraphQL queries against Shopify schema
- Use TypeScript types generated from GraphQL schemas
- Test components in isolation before integration
- Follow accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Optimize images and assets
- Use semantic HTML

## Common Tasks
- Adding new routes: Create file in `app/routes/` following React Router 7 conventions
- Adding components: Create in `app/components/` and export
- GraphQL queries: Add to `app/graphql/` and run `npm run codegen`
- Styling: Use Tailwind classes, add custom styles in `app/styles/`
